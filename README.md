# ETV app
Another attempt at building a nice ETV app.

## Development
Assuming you already have the necessary tools:
1. Clone this repository
2. Inside the repository, run:  
`flutter pub get`  
`flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create`
3. You can now `flutter run` the app. :)

### Android
To set up your Flutter development environment:
1. [Install the flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. a. install an Android emulator (via the AVD Manager in the Android SDK)  
   b. connect an Android phone with USB debugging enabled via a USB cable

### iOS
No idea, this is a `//TODO`.
